# 04/06/2020
# Objectives
# Learn to use sorting algorithms
# Learn to use searching algorithms
# Learn to use recursion in the implementation of algorithms
# Exercises
# Write a Java program that will implement the Bubble Sort algorithm as a method and sort the following array of integers:
# {10, 4, 7, 3, 8, 6, 1, 2, 5, 9}
# Write a Java program that will implement the Insertion Sort algorithm as a method and sort the following array of Strings:
# {"cat", "fat", "dog", "apple", "bat", "egg"}
# Write a Java program that will implement the Binary Search algorithm as a recursive method and be able to search the following array of Strings for a specific value, input by the user:
# {"c", "html", "java", "python", "ruby", "scala"}
